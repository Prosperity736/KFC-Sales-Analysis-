Restaurant Sales Analysis 


This project represents the intersection of data analytics, business intelligence and automation — turning raw sales data into actionable insights and proactive alerts for management decision making.
The dashboard doesn’t just show data . It tells the story of KFC’s revenue journey and where it’s headed.(2023-2025 datasets).

After weeks of dedicated work, I’ve built a comprehensive Sales Intelligence System for KFC that combines the power of Power BI and Power Automate to deliver real-time revenue insights and automated alerts.
